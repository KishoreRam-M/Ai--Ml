# Q1. PEAS Description of Task Environments

PEAS stands for:  

- **P → Performance measure** (how success is judged)  
- **E → Environment** (where the agent works)  
- **A → Actuators** (how it acts)  
- **S → Sensors** (how it senses the world)  

Let us describe for each agent:

## (a) Robot Soccer Player

**Performance measure:**  
- Number of goals scored  
- Number of goals saved  
- Team coordination  
- Avoiding fouls  

**Environment:**  
Soccer ground, ball, goalpost, opponents, teammates, referees, audience  

**Actuators:**  
- Motors to move legs and arms  
- Kicking device  
- Steering and balancing controls  

**Sensors:**  
- Camera (to see ball and players)  
- Gyroscope (to balance)  
- Microphone (to hear referee whistle)  
- Touch sensors (to feel ball contact)  

**Diagram (simple):**  
```

Input (Sensors: Camera, Gyroscope) → Agent Brain → Output (Actuators: Kick, Move, Save)

```

## (b) Internet Book Shopping Agent

**Performance measure:**  
- Customer satisfaction  
- Finding correct book fast  
- Best price and timely delivery  

**Environment:**  
Internet websites, book database, payment system, delivery system  

**Actuators:**  
- Displaying results to customer  
- Sending requests to database  
- Confirming orders, making payments  

**Sensors:**  
- User input (keywords, preferences)  
- Database info (price, availability)  
- User feedback (ratings, clicks)  

**Diagram (simple):**  
```

Input (Sensors: User request, Database info) → Agent Brain → Output (Actuators: Display results, Place order)

```

# Q2. AI-based Traffic Signal Control System

## (a) PEAS Description

**Performance measure:**  
- Minimize waiting time of vehicles  
- Reduce traffic jams  
- Ensure pedestrian safety  
- Smooth traffic flow  

**Environment:**  
Roads, junctions, vehicles, pedestrians, emergency vehicles, weather  

**Actuators:**  
- Traffic lights (red, yellow, green)  
- Pedestrian crossing signals  
- Alarms for emergency vehicles  

**Sensors:**  
- Cameras on roads  
- Vehicle detectors (inductive loops, GPS data)  
- Pedestrian sensors, weather sensors  

## (b) How Search Algorithms Can Help

Search algorithms are used to find the best sequence of light changes.  

**Example:**  
- At a junction, signals can be red/green in many combinations.  
- The agent searches through possible combinations to minimize total waiting time.  
- Algorithms like Breadth-First Search, A* can plan shortest waiting paths.  
- Example: A* can calculate the best green light duration for each lane.

## (c) Learning-based Improvement

- Traffic patterns change with time (morning rush, night empty roads).  
- A learning agent can observe data and adapt.  
- Example: Use Reinforcement Learning → the agent gets reward when waiting time reduces.  
- Over time, it learns best timings automatically.  
- Result → Smart signals that self-adjust daily, like human police officer.

# Q3. Water Jug Problem (4-gallon and 3-gallon jugs)

## Problem Statement

We have:  
- One 4-gallon jug  
- One 3-gallon jug  
- A pump with unlimited water  

**Goal:** get exactly 2 gallons in the 4-gallon jug

## Operators Allowed

- Fill a jug fully from pump  
- Empty a jug onto ground  
- Pour water from one jug to another until one is full or other is empty  

## Step-by-step Solution

1. Fill 3-gallon jug completely.  
   (State: 4-gallon = 0, 3-gallon = 3)  
2. Pour 3-gallon jug into 4-gallon jug.  
   (State: 4-gallon = 3, 3-gallon = 0)  
3. Fill 3-gallon jug again from pump.  
   (State: 4-gallon = 3, 3-gallon = 3)  
4. Pour from 3-gallon jug into 4-gallon jug until it is full.  
   - 4-gallon jug already has 3 gallons, so it takes only 1 gallon.  
   - Leftover in 3-gallon jug = 2 gallons.  
   (State: 4-gallon = 4, 3-gallon = 2)  
5. Empty 4-gallon jug onto ground.  
   (State: 4-gallon = 0, 3-gallon = 2)  
6. Pour 2 gallons from 3-gallon jug into 4-gallon jug.  
   (Final State: 4-gallon = 2, 3-gallon = 0 ✅ Goal achieved!)

## Diagram (simple states)

```

Step 1: (0,3)
Step 2: (3,0)
Step 3: (3,3)
Step 4: (4,2)
Step 5: (0,2)
Step 6: (2,0) → Goal!

```

## Explanation in Easy Words

Think like two buckets, one big and one small.  
You keep filling, pouring, and emptying until you cleverly leave 2 liters in the big one.  
This is how computers solve problems: by breaking into small steps (states).

## Final Review (Quick Points for Memory)

- PEAS = Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors  
- Traffic Signal Agent → uses search + learning to reduce jams  
- Water Jug Problem → solved step-by-step using operators and state diagrams

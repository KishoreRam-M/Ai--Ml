# Q11. Analyze the Uninformed and Informed searching strategies

**Uninformed Search (Blind):** No extra knowledge, explores blindly.  
Examples: BFS, DFS, UCS.  

**Informed Search (Heuristic):** Uses problem-specific knowledge (heuristics).  
Examples: A*, Greedy.  

**Time & Space:** Uninformed → slower, more memory; Informed → faster, less memory.  
**Completeness:** BFS, UCS, A* are complete; DFS may not be.  
**Optimality:** UCS and A* (with admissible heuristic) are optimal.

# Q12. Classify search algorithms

**Blind / Uninformed Search:** No heuristic.  
Examples: BFS, DFS, UCS, DLS.  

**Heuristic / Informed Search:** Uses heuristics to guide search.  
Examples: A*, Greedy Best-First Search.  

So, problem-solving algorithms are classified as Uninformed (blind search) and Informed (heuristic-based).

# Q13. Evaluate performance of search strategies

Performance of search strategies is measured by:  

- **Time Complexity** → How many nodes expanded.  
- **Space Complexity** → How much memory is needed.  
- **Completeness** → Will it always find a solution if one exists?  
- **Optimality** → Does it give the best (shortest/cheapest) solution?  

Example: BFS → complete & optimal, but high time/space.

# Q14. Evaluate performance of DFS

- **Time Complexity:** O(b^m) (m = max depth)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(bm), very low memory  
- **Completeness:** Not complete (can get stuck in infinite paths)  
- **Optimality:** Not optimal (may find longer path)  

So, DFS is memory-efficient but risky for infinite or large search spaces.

# Q15. Which uninformed search strategies apply with no knowledge?

When no domain-specific knowledge is available, we use Blind (Uninformed) Searches:  

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)  
- Depth-First Search (DFS)  
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)  
- Depth-Limited Search (DLS)  
- Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)  

# Q16. Techniques for overcoming ridges & plateaus in Hill Climbing

- **Random Restart:** Try again from a new random state.  
- **Simulated Annealing:** Allow occasional worse moves to escape local maxima.  
- **Stochastic Hill Climbing:** Choose random neighbor moves.  
- **Look-ahead (Sideways moves):** Move sideways across plateau until better state found.  

# Q17. Extend Minimax to games with chance

For games involving chance (dice, cards, probability), Minimax is extended into the **Expectiminimax** algorithm.  

- Instead of only MAX and MIN nodes, we add **Chance nodes** that represent random outcomes.  
- Each move is evaluated based on **expected utility** (probability × payoff).  

Example: Backgammon uses Expectiminimax for decision-making.

# Q18. Solve Map Coloring & Cryptarithmetic with CSP

**Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP):** Assign values to variables under constraints.  

**Map Coloring:**  
- Each region = variable  
- Colors = values  
- Constraint: no two adjacent regions have same color (e.g., 4-color map)  

**Cryptarithmetic:**  
- Letters = variables  
- Digits = values  
- Constraint: all digits different  

Example: SEND + MORE = MONEY solved by assigning digits consistently to letters.

# Q1 & Q2. Are reflex actions (such as flinching from a hot stove) rational? Are they intelligent?

Reflex actions are quick automatic responses done by our body without thinking.  
Example: hand pulls back immediately when touching a hot stove.  
They are not rational, because no reasoning or logic is used.  
They are not intelligent, because no learning or decision-making happens.  
They are controlled by the spinal cord, not the brain.  
So reflex = safety reaction, not intelligence.

# Q3. Is AI a science, or is it engineering? Or neither or both? Explain

AI is both science and engineering.  
As a science, it studies ideas of thinking, reasoning, and learning like humans.  
As engineering, it builds real systems like robots, chatbots, and self-driving cars.  
It uses subjects like math, logic, psychology, and computer science.  
So AI = scientific study + engineering practice.

# Q4. Describe the basic procedure of Turing Test, what role does the Human evaluator play?

The Turing Test checks if a machine can behave like a human.  
There are three players: a machine, a human, and a human evaluator.  
The evaluator talks to both (through text) but does not know who is who.  
If the evaluator cannot tell which one is the machine, then machine is intelligent.  
The evaluator’s role = judge the answers and decide human vs machine.

# Q5. Construct a PEAS model for an intelligent agent and classify its type with justification.

PEAS = Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors.  
Example: Self-driving car agent  

**Performance measure:** safety, reaching destination, saving fuel.  
**Environment:** roads, traffic, pedestrians.  
**Actuators:** steering, brakes, accelerator, horn.  
**Sensors:** cameras, radar, GPS.  

This is a real-time, goal-based, intelligent agent.

# Q6. Mention a few areas where Artificial Intelligence is used today.

AI is used in many real-life areas:  

**Healthcare:** disease detection, medical robots.  
**Education:** smart tutoring, language translation.  
**Transport:** self-driving cars, traffic control.  
**Business:** chatbots, fraud detection.  
**Entertainment:** recommendation (YouTube, Netflix).  

So AI = part of daily life everywhere.

# Q7. In what ways do toy problems differ from real-world problems in terms of complexity and applicability?

Toy problems are small, simple, and clear (like puzzles, chess).  
Rules are fixed, environment is known, and solutions are easy to test.  
Real-world problems are large, complex, and uncertain (like weather, driving).  
They involve huge data, incomplete info, and unpredictable changes.  
Toy = good for learning, Real-world = practical but harder.

# Q8. Identify the various types of agents used in AI systems? Describe any one type with diagram.

Types of AI agents:  

- Simple reflex agent  
- Model-based reflex agent  
- Goal-based agent  
- Utility-based agent  
- Learning agent  

Example: Simple reflex agent → works only on current input, no memory.  
Eg: Room heater turns ON if temperature is low.  
(Diagram: Input → Condition check → Action)

# Q9. Define the terms goal formulation and problem formulation in search strategies.

**Goal formulation:** deciding what the agent wants to achieve.  
Example: “Reach home safely.”  

**Problem formulation:** deciding the steps, actions, and rules to reach goal.  
Example: choosing shortest path, avoiding traffic.  

So goal = target, problem = method to reach target.

# Q10. Which metrics would you apply to evaluate the effectiveness of a problem-solving agent?

Important metrics are:  

- **Completeness** – will it find a solution if one exists?  
- **Optimality** – is the solution the best one?  
- **Time complexity** – how fast it finds solution.  
- **Space complexity** – how much memory it uses.  

These metrics tell how effective and efficient the agent is.

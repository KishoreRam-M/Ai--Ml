### **Need in AI**

1. **Real world is uncertain:** Weather, traffic, and human behavior are not 100% predictable.
2. **Incomplete information:** AI often has only partial facts.
3. **Better decisions:** Using probabilities helps AI choose the **most likely or safest option**.

**Example:**

* A robot sees clouds. Using probabilistic reasoning, it can guess the **chance of rain** and decide whether to take an umbrella.

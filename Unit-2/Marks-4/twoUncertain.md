* Rainfall tomorrow → $R$
* Sunshine tomorrow → $S$

### **Step 1: Combined likelihood**

The “combined likelihood” means the **probability that both happen together**.

* If the events are **independent** (one doesn’t affect the other):

$$
P(R \text{ and } S) = P(R) \times P(S)
$$

* If the events are **dependent** (one affects the other), we use **conditional probability**:

$$
P(R \text{ and } S) = P(R|S) \times P(S)
$$

Here, $P(R|S)$ = probability it rains **given** that it is sunny.

### **Step 2: Example**

* Suppose probability of rain = 0.3
* Probability of sunshine = 0.5

**If independent:**

$$
P(R \text{ and } S) = 0.3 \times 0.5 = 0.15
$$

So, there’s a **15% chance** both rain and sunshine occur (like a sunshower!).

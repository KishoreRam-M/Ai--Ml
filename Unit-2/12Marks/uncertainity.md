## **1. What is Uncertainty?**

* Happens when you **don’t know what will happen**.
* Different from risk: with risk, you **know the probabilities** (like a coin toss).
* Under uncertainty, you **don’t know the chances**.
* Example: You don’t know if a new product will be popular.

## **2. Ways to Make Decisions Under Uncertainty**

| Approach                              | Idea                                            | Example                                                         |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Optimistic (Maximax)**              | Hope for the best outcome                       | Startup invests heavily assuming demand grows fast              |
| **Pessimistic (Maximin)**             | Prepare for the worst                           | Farmer grows drought-proof crops even if profit is low          |
| **Realism (Hurwicz)**                 | Mix optimism and pessimism                      | Balance risky vs safe choices when launching a product          |
| **Minimax Regret**                    | Reduce regret if decision goes wrong            | Investor spreads money across different stocks                  |
| **Bayesian (Probabilistic Thinking)** | Use estimated probabilities to make best choice | Doctors use probabilities when diagnosing with incomplete tests |

## **3. Real-Life Examples**

* **Business**: Launching a product without knowing customer reaction → run small tests first.
* **Healthcare**: Treat patients even if the diagnosis is not 100% clear → use probabilities and past experience.
* **Farming**: Decide what to plant without knowing weather → plant mixed crops or check forecasts.
* **Stock Market**: Markets are unpredictable → diversify investments, use stop-loss strategies.
* **Personal Life**: Choosing a career → learn multiple skills or pick flexible options.
